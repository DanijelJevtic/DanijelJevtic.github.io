## Introduction

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person or group using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Unlike traditional currencies, which are controlled by central authorities such as governments or banks, Bitcoin operates on a decentralized network of computers that use cryptography to secure and verify transactions. This makes Bitcoin a "peer-to-peer" currency that allows users to send and receive payments without the need for intermediaries.

The trading market for Bitcoin has grown significantly over the past few years, with more and more investors and traders entering the market. Bitcoin is now traded on a number of exchanges, with the largest and most popular being Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken. The market price of Bitcoin is determined by supply and demand, and can be highly volatile due to a number of factors, including changes in regulatory environments, news events, and the actions of large investors.[1]
