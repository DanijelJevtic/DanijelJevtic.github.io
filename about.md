Some information about you!

### More Information

Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Danijel Jevtic, and I am a data scientist and finance enthusiast. I graduated with a Master of Science in Banking and Finance, majoring in Capital Markets and Data Science. Prior to that, I completed a Bachelor of Science in Economic Engineering, majoring in Financial Mathematics.

My academic background has provided me with a solid foundation in statistical data mining, econometrics, mathematics of financial markets, and stochastic processes, among other areas. I have experience with various unsupervised and supervised methods, including clustering algorithms, regression trees, ensemble methods, and support vector machines, as well as feedforward neural networks and recurrent neural networks. Additionally, I have studied conditional volatility models, time series analysis, and other econometric techniques for financial data analysis.

My passion for finance and technology led me to explore the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in trading strategies. 

Apart from my academic pursuits, I have been involved in martial arts for 8 years and have been playing piano for the same amount of time. Additionally, I enjoy playing basketball and traveling in my free time.

I am excited to share my knowledge and insights on quantitative finance and data science with you through this blog. Thank you for reading, and I hope you find my content informative and engaging.
